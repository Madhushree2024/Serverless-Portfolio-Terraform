# ☁️ Serverless-Portfolio-Infrastructure

## 📌 Overview
This project is an end-to-end serverless portfolio platform architected for high availability and zero-cost maintenance. It features a real-time visitor tracking system built with a **microservices backend**. The entire stack is provisioned via **Terraform (IaC)** and deployed through a **GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline**, demonstrating a modern DevOps workflow.

---

## 🚀 Features
* **Global Delivery**: Leveraging **Amazon CloudFront** for sub-second latency and automated SSL/TLS termination at edge locations.
* **Atomic State Management**: A Python-based **AWS Lambda** function handles concurrent visitor updates to **DynamoDB** using atomic increments to ensure data integrity.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: 100% of the cloud environment is version-controlled and reproducible using Terraform.
* **State Protection**: Implemented Terraform `lifecycle` rules to prevent database records from being overwritten or reset during infrastructure updates.
* **Automated CI/CD**: Seamless deployment of both frontend assets (S3) and backend logic (Lambda) on every `git push`.

## 📊 Proof of Work (Verified Jan 4, 2026)
The project is fully operational and validated through the following metrics:
* **Successful Deployment**: GitHub Actions workflow logs confirm 0 failures across all 12+ AWS resources.
* **Traffic Security**: Verified 100% HTTPS enforcement via CloudFront built-in SSL/TLS termination.
* **Persistence Test**: Confirmed visitor count remains stable and increments correctly across multiple `terraform apply` cycles.
* **Observability**: CloudWatch log streams successfully capturing Lambda execution and API request status for real-time debugging.

## 📝 How to Use
* 1.Provision Infrastructure: Run terraform init and terraform apply to build the cloud environment.
* 2.Configure CI/CD: Add AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY to your GitHub Repository Secrets.
* 3.Connect Backend: Update the API_URL in the index.html JavaScript with the output generated by Terraform.
* 4.Deploy: Push changes to the main branch to trigger the automated build and sync process.
